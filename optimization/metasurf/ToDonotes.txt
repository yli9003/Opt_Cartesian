- clean up the reference field calculation. as of now, there is some bug with the reference field calculated outside the opt function call.

- the above would streamline the calculation and save computation time

- implement the constraint frac*|Eref|^2 - |E|^2 < 0 to ensure a threshold transmission

- fix the filename passing issue

- implement more streamlined multiwavelength minimax optimization
